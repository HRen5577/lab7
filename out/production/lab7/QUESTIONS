 Do I have to rely on user for the correct code? (Y)

Do I check the dates and total occupied first get them or in the prepared statement
//check total occupied are too much

What to do if over occupied or conflicting dates? -> back to menu?

LOCK USERS INPUT TO (UNLESS "q")
    bedType -> set of all bedTypes from "SELECT bedType FROM lab7_rooms"
    roomCode -> set of all bedTypes from "SELECT roomCodes FROM lab7_rooms"
    numChildren -> 0 < num < 5
    numAdults -> 0 < num < 5
    totalOcc -> if num is greater than "SELECT max()" THAN return back to menu

    Only allow dates to be inputted (YYYY-MM-DD)
    if not then repeat until you do


HOW TO DO NUMBER 6? getting revenue per month between reservtions
number two total cost Sql and Java

Allow for incorrect information to be inputted? Y
Am I assuming the user knows the roomCodes and reservation Code, bed type and so on (Y)
ASSUME USER KNOWS WHAT IS INPUTTING UNLESS SQL injection


What do you mean a range of dates? (start and end)
reservation [all year popularity] (OKAY)
transactions (2, 3, 4)
